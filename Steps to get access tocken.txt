To get a Spotify refresh token using Postman, you need to use the Authorization Code flow. This process involves obtaining an initial authorization code through a browser and then exchanging that code for an access token and a refresh token in Postman. 
Prerequisites
Spotify Developer Dashboard:
Log in to your Spotify Developer Dashboard.
Create a new app (if you haven't already).
Note your Client ID and Client Secret.
In the app's settings, add a Redirect URI. For use with Postman, a common practice is to use https://www.postman.com/oauth2/callback. 
Step-by-Step Guide
Part 1: Get the Authorization Code
Open a new request tab in Postman.
Go to the Authorization tab.
Select OAuth 2.0 from the Type dropdown.
Under Configure New Token, set the following values:
Token Name: Spotify Auth (or any name you prefer)
Grant Type: Authorization Code
Callback URL: https://www.postman.com/oauth2/callback (must match the Redirect URI in your Spotify app settings)
Auth URL: https://accounts.spotify.com/authorize
Access Token URL: https://accounts.spotify.com/api/token
Client ID: Your Spotify Client ID
Client Secret: Your Spotify Client Secret
Scope: Enter the desired scopes (e.g., user-read-private user-read-email playlist-read-private playlist-modify-private are common, separated by spaces).
State: (Optional) Can be left empty or set to a random value.
Client Authentication: Select Send client credentials in body.
Click the Get New Access Token button.
A new browser window or Postman pop-up will open, prompting you to log in to Spotify and authorize your app's access.
After you approve, you will be redirected to the Callback URL, and Postman will capture the authorization code.
Postman will then show a window with the generated Access Token and, importantly, the Refresh Token.
Select Use Token to store the token for your request.
